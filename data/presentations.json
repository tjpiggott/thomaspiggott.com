        "overview": "This workshop takes a short time to introduce pairing and then gets right into the activity: pairing promiscuously! The activity has people work as a pair and then re-pair and re-pair again as they build on previous work. This intent is to show people that working with others, quickly and creatively, can help make work more fun and more productive.",

        "overview": "This presentation helps demonstrate the importance of using a realistic scenario when assessing designs. Using scenarios (workflow-based stories that provide a framework for getting user feedback) allows the user to give more honest, relevant feedback more closely related to the work they do on an everyday basis.",
